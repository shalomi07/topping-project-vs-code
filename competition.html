                <p>Hello! This is Dinfrog, your personal dino assistant! Some call him a frog for a reason, while some accept him as truly a dino.</p>
                <p>Don't be afraid, he's cute and kind! But you might want to note something.</p>
                <p>One thing about Dinfrog: HE LOVES ICE CREAM! And, you better get away from his ice cream, or he'll be as grumpy as a witch!</p>
